To host a poker game download this repository and then run the file within it called poker.py. After inputting the players name open the created file named player_info.txt and send each player their card_offset and card_multiplyer values so that they can use card_decryptor.py to decode their down cards

If playing in a game run card_decryptor.py

note - if not using linex system or system that runs bash you will need to use colorless cards
